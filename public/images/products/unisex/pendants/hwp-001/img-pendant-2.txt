Designed for those who value meaning as much as elegance, this pendant is a modern symbol of balance, identity, and quiet confidence. Its refined geometry—defined by a vertical line intersecting a perfect circle—represents alignment, purpose, and continuity, making it more than an accessory; it is a personal signature.

Crafted in polished white gold and accented with a precisely set diamond, the pendant delivers subtle brilliance without excess. Its proportions are intentionally restrained, allowing it to sit naturally at the collarbone and layer effortlessly with other pieces, or stand alone as a statement of refined taste.

This is jewelry designed to be worn daily, collected intentionally, and kept for years.
