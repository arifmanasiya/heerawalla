This pendant is designed around balance and intention. The circular form symbolizes continuity and wholeness, while the vertical axis introduces purpose, direction, and personal grounding. Together, they create a form that feels calm, centered, and timeless - never loud, yet instantly distinctive.

Worn on the body, it feels natural and personal. The dime-sized scale keeps it subtle enough for everyday wear, while the refined detailing - diamonds set with visible prongs, clean metal planes, and a precision-engraved signature mark - signals craftsmanship and authenticity. The reversible design adds depth: one side offers brilliance and light, the other a minimalist, symbolic expression of identity.

It is deliberately unisex, equally confident on men and women. Not trend-driven, but meaning-driven - something you wear because it resonates, and keep because it becomes part of your story.
