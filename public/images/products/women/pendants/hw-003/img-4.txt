The back of the pendant is intentionally clean and refined, designed to let the diamond take center stage without distraction. A minimal open-gallery allows light to flow freely through the stone, enhancing brilliance from every angle while reducing unnecessary metal weight. The discreet, low-profile setting sits flush against the skin for all-day comfort and a seamless look when worn. Every surface is smoothly finished, reflecting thoughtful craftsmanship and a commitment to understated elegance—proof that true luxury is just as beautiful where you don’t immediately look.
