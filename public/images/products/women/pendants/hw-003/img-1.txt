Defined by pure simplicity and enduring elegance, a single brilliant-cut diamond is secured in a minimal, refined mount that allows maximum light return, keeping the diamond the focal point.

Designed to be age-agnostic and effortlessly versatile, the pendant moves from a first meaningful gift to an everyday signature piece. Balanced proportions and a classic silhouette keep it timeless.

Suspended on a delicate chain, the solitaire rests at the collarbone, ideal for daily wear, layering, or special occasions. It is understated for day and refined for evening.
