The pendant features two perfectly symmetrical concentric rings—one polished gold, one diamond-set—suspended in harmonious alignment. The clean geometry allows the diamonds to take center stage, while the smooth gold interior adds warmth and depth.

Elegant in form and lightweight on the neckline, this pendant is designed to sit gracefully at the collarbone, offering quiet luxury with lasting appeal.
