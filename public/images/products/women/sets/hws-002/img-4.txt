The open bangle completes the set with a sleek, contemporary finish. A continuous line of diamonds runs along the outer edge, framed by polished gold for a clean, architectural look. The open design offers both comfort and modern appeal, while maintaining a refined, high-jewelry presence.

Whether worn alone or paired with the full set, it delivers understated sophistication.
